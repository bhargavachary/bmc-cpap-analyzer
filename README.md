## Troubleshooting

### No files found
- Ensure BMC data files are in the same directory as the script
- Check file naming format (should be `DEVICEID.000`, `DEVICEID.001`, etc.)

### Unexpected results
- Verify data files are complete BMC RESmart SD card exports
- Try different timeframe analysis (3, 6, or 12 months)
- Check that device ID is correctly detected

### No pressure data extracted
- Files may be corrupted or from different device model
- Try updating the parsing method for your specific device variant
